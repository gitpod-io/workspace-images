# Contributor / Maintainer FAQ

## How are these images built?

Here is a short video that shows how this repository works:

[<img alt="How Gitpod's Default Workspace Images are Built" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/599268/106449039-d7dcd780-6483-11eb-91c4-e4e012b9d78b.png" width="600">](https://youtu.be/0lnZak5cCT0)

It briefly explains:

- What are the different Dockerfiles in here?
- How do they relate to each other?
- How does CircleCI build them?
- Which images are built with Dazzle or not (and what's the difference)?
- How to upgrade tools in workspace-full?

## How to contribute?

- Simply open this repository in Gitpod, for example by clicking this button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images)

- Next, implement your change, and open a Pull Request.

- Then ask a maintainer (for example @jankeromnes) to make CircleCI build your Pull Request.

- Finally, once the build passes, test your new Docker images on a relevant repository.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: CircleCI will upload temporary images from your Pull Request to Docker Hub, using a special tag that looks like this:
> `gitpod/workspace-full:branch-pr-123` (assuming your Pull Request is number 123)
>
> You can test this temporary image by editing one of your projects' [.gitpod.yml](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-gitpod-file/) file like so (maybe on a separate branch):
>
> ```yml
> image: gitpod/workspace-full:branch-pr-123
> ```
>
> Finally, once this change is committed and pushed to your repository, you can open your test repository or branch in Gitpod to test the project with your new image.
> Please ask for help if you're not sure what to do.

## How to make CircleCI build a PR?

CircleCI only builds branches of [gitpod-io/workspace-images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images), not forks, so Pull Requests sent from forks will not have CircleCI builds by default.

But there is a way to make CircleCI build Pull Requests even when they were sent from a fork.

If you have push access to [gitpod-io/workspace-images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images), simply open the PR in Gitpod, and do the following:

```bash
git checkout -b pr-123 # Tip: Use the actual PR number
git push upstream pr-123
```

That's it. Simply pushing the Pull Request's commits to a new branch under `upstream` is enough to trigger CircleCI for that PR. Pretty soon the build status will appear in the Pull Request, automatically.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: If CircleCI fails to build a particular image, but you believe it's a temporary problem (for example a network timeout) you can restart builds directly from CircleCI's UI.
