[![Build from Main](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/actions/workflows/push-main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/actions/workflows/push-main.yml)

Ready-to-use Docker images for [gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io) workspaces.
All images are available on [Gitpod's Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod).

For an example of how to use these images, please take a look at the [documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-public-docker-image).

## üì¢ Announcements

We upgraded to support [dazzle v2](https://github.com/gitpod-io/dazzle) and build with GitHub Actions.

## Summary

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- **OS Type**: Linux
- **Architecture**: x86_64

## Images

By default, Gitpod uses a standard Docker Image called
[`workspace-full`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/HEAD/dazzle.yaml#L23) as the foundation for workspaces.

Workspaces started based on this default image come pre-installed with
Docker, Nix, Go, Java, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Rust & PHP as well as tools such as Homebrew, Tailscale, Nginx & several more.

If this image does not include the tools you need for your repository, we recommend you start with
[`workspace-base`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/HEAD/dazzle.yaml#L3) and customize it according to your needs.
You can refer to this [document to setup a custom docker image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image).

#### Versions we'll maintain

For images dedicated to Java, Node, Python and Ruby, their lifecycle generally works as follows:

- If an image does not have a version in its name, we try to keep it at its latest stable version
- If an image is versioned (like `workspace-python-3.12`), we'll support it until it reached End of Life

## Where to follow new updates

- **Announcements**: Significant changes and breaking updates are announced through the [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) file with details.
- **Recently Merged Changes**: For checking new features or updates staged for next deployment that don't warrant everyone's attention, browse through the [merged pull requests](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged).
- **Image Updates**: Every Monday, [a GitHub action](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/actions/workflows/dockerhub-release.yml?query=is%3Asuccess) automatically builds and updates the images based on the `main` branch. Once built, these images are made available on [Gitpod's Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod).
