# Install asdf to make it easier to manage elixir versions
#
# Why?
# 1. At the time of this writing, `apt-get install elixir` was installing
# a version that was not compatible with glibc in Ubuntu Jammy.
# 2. This makes it explicit as to what versions we're installing.
# 3. It'll give users the ability to easily make changes at runtime to experiment
